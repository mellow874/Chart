Created a CryptX dashboard built using react, and tailwindcss
It is a replica of the figma dashboard we were assigned to build
Upon opening the dashboard, you have got your sidebar with all the list items
At the top you've got your header which contains the input form for the searchbar, then contains the 2 icons which are the notification and hhelp icons, and lastly the user profile
Below that you've got the crypto coins and the BTC chart showing the trend of the market, and below the crypto market you've got the live market and the transactions.
